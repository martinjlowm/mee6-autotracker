* MEE6 Autotracker

Part of the MEE6 Kingdom, this MEE6 tracks hours for you automatically and
prompts you daily if there are any adjustments to be made on Slack. This is
unrelated to https://mee6.xyz/.

** Setup

There's a daily CloudWatch rule that triggers a Slack prompt at 9 UTC every
morning Mon-Fri and schedules a registration event to be processed 8 hours later
(roughly). During this time, interacting with MEE6 in Slack, this event can be
adjusted to 0-6 hours, if 8 hours does not apply for that particular day.

When the 8 hours is up, the record expires and fires yet another Lambda which
registers the desired time in Harvest.

** Deployment

The infrastructure is defined with AWS CDK and deployed with:

#+begin_src bash
npx cdk deploy
#+end_src
